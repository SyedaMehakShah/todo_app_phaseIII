# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo AI Chatbot System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED

All checklist items validated successfully:

1. **Content Quality**: Spec focuses on user journeys and business outcomes without mentioning specific technologies in requirements
2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 18 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance scenarios
3. **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (time-based, percentage-based, count-based)
4. **Edge Cases**: 6 edge cases identified covering error conditions and boundary scenarios
5. **Scope**: Clear "Out of Scope" section defines boundaries

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- No clarifications required - user input was comprehensive
- Assumptions documented for any inferred decisions
